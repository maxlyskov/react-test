What's done: Accomplished tasks include responsive web design implementation and creation of a mobile version for site navigation. The sidebar facilitates user transitions to various pages, although content is only available for '/stories' and the main landing page. Additionally, an engaging slider on the sidebar enhances user interest in the website. The "Stories" section features table search functionality, filtering, and pagination.
